This is a open source project about a Bone Suppression Medical Imaging Generation Platforma
It is a front-end portal project developed using the vue3 composite API and vite


This medical imaging platform for bone suppression rates can achieve basic adjustment functions for medical images, 
including parameters such as contrast, brightness, and bone suppression rates, as well as basic functions such as text labeling and image rotation.


The specific operation process is to select an image from the local computer for upload, 
and the backend will automatically return the medical image processed by the algorithm. 
The user can make adjustments and then click the button to export.

This project has completed the bilingual adaptation of Chinese and English, allowing for free switching in the upper right corner.
